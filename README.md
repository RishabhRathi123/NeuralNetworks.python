## Introduction

This project aims to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on the popular Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset and can be used as a baseline for more complex image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset I have used for this project consists of a dataset of Images on my Desktop containing 4000 labeled images of dogs and cats each for Training_Set and 1000 images of each for Validation_Set but you can also use [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) from Kaggle. It consists of 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats (12,500 images of each class).

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture includes the following layers:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Dropout layers for regularization

The detailed architecture is defined in the `model.py` file.

## Training

The model is trained using the following configuration:

- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Batch Size: 32
- Number of Epochs: 25

Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip are applied to increase the diversity of the training data.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on a separate validation set to monitor its performance. Accuracy and loss metrics are used to evaluate the model. The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the learning progress.
